# IMDB-Data-set-using-pandas


## 📄 Project Overview  
A data-analysis project using Python, Pandas, numpy — aimed at exploring a movies dataset (based on IMDb / public data).  
The goal is to extract insights on movie trends, ratings, revenues, genres and other features — to understand what factors are associated
with movie success (rating or revenue) and how those patterns change over time.

## 🧰 Dataset & Data Description  
Typical fields in the dataset include (when available):  
- Movie title  
- Release year  
- Genre(s)  
- Director / Crew  
- Runtime / Duration  
- User rating (IMDb rating)  
- Vote count / popularity metrics  
- Revenue / gross (if available)  
- Other metadata (e.g. production country, language, etc.)

## 🔎 What the Analysis Covers  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicates, data-type conversions)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  - Distributions of ratings, revenues, runtime, votes  
  - Year-wise and genre-wise summaries of key metrics  
- Correlation & relationship analysis between numeric features (e.g. rating vs revenue, runtime vs votes), visualized using heatmaps and plots  
- Group-by / Aggregation analyses: e.g. examining which genres or directors tend to produce higher-rated or higher-earning movies  
- Identifying and listing top movies by rating, revenue, or other criteria;
- tracking trends over time (e.g. number of movies released per year, average revenue/rating per decade)  

## ⚙️ Tools & Dependencies  
The project uses:  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy — for data manipulation   
- Jupyter Notebook  — for interactive exploration and analysis  

## 🚀 How to Run / Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
2. Install dependencies (e.g. via pip or conda).  
3. Place your dataset (CSV / TSV) in a `data/` directory or update the notebook/script with the correct path.  
4. Run the notebook or script — perform cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.  
5. View results (plots, summaries) or export them (e.g. to `.csv`, `.png`, report files) as required.
